A Prayer to Guru Rinpoche That Spontaneously Fulfils All Wishes
From the Extremely Secret Assembly of Sugatas
revealed by Garwang Chökyi Gyaltsen

When the time is right, the heart essence of Vidyādhara Padma,The expanse of his wisdom, both
profound and vast, is the very life-force of the motherly ḍākinīs.The rays of their heart
– the auspiciousness unfolding of its prophetic guide – Is a key with which to open a hundred
doors without the slightest impediment. Sealed.

Zoṃ!The guide will be revealed elsewhere.Padmasambhava, master over all that appears and exists,
said, “Alas, the nature of these times! Malevolent samaya-breakers roam in central landsAs
corrupt teachings appear,And haughty devils fill the borderlands. It is a time of dispute
and violent argument – When demons and spirits possess the population; And horrific
weaponry rains down in ever-increasing numbers. A time when all men will die by the sword;When
sickness, famine, pandemics, plagues, and infectious diseases will spread widely. So-called
dharma practitioners will be nothing more than vulgar charlatans;Non-dharmic teaching
will spread whilst the profound dharma fades. During such times, my emanations will be
treated like dogs;The orbits of the sun and moon and passage of the stars will falter;Emanations
of destructive ministers will appear in the guise of monks and fill the earth. At these
times, my compassion will be extraordinarily swift. However, those who trust and supplicate
me will be extremely rare. Therefore, my child, during such times, don’t let your exertions
diminish! Pray to your old father, Padmasambhava! Extract a jewel-like treasure of
symbolic wisdom, use it,And things will change – the children will inherit the fortune of
their father!”

oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
Recite the mantra as many times as you can.

After your prayer, rest within the primordially pure inseparability of the guru and your mind.

This profound supplication is an auxiliary practice of the profound dharma, Assembly of Sugatas.
And, when the winds of these times move, the wrathful dharma-holders will reveal it.
Accordingly, the old charlatan Draktong Dorje, beheld the symbolic script written in vermillion
within a wrathful torma and, with a pure devotion for Padmasambhava, wrote it down.

May this be of impartial benefit to all beings and the counsel herein be cherished and kept
under a seal of secrecy, a seal of being hidden, a seal of profundity, and under the protection
of the dharmapālas.

This prayer may not be to everyone’s liking, and some may find it amusing. However, for those
with faith who have the fortune to receive it, it is anything but… So take care that it
doesn’t fall into the hands of samaya-breakers!
